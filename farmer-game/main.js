/**
 * @fileoverview Entry point for the Farmer Harvest Game
 * 
 *
 * 
 * - I replaced anonymous callbacks with arrow functions and added notes about why.
 * - There are a couple of `.bind(this)` calls, mainly for event listeners that need to be cleaned up later.
 * - `this` is being used in three main places:
 *     1. Inside the requestAnimationFrame (RAF) loop
 *     2. In event listeners
 *     3. When calling class methods
