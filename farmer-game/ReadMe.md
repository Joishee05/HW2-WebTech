New Features Implemented

Multiple Crop Types: The game now includes three different crops with varying point values. Wheat gives you 1 point and is the most common crop you'll find. Pumpkins are worth 3 points and appear less frequently. Golden apples are the rarest and most valuable at 5 points each. 

Power-up System: Two power-ups were added to the game. The speed boost temporarily increases your movement speed. The scythe power-up allows you to collect crops in a wide radius around your character without having to touch them directly. Both power-ups have visual indicators and limited duration timers.

Visual Effects: The game includes floating score indicators that show how many points you earned from each crop, making the scoring system more transparent.

JavaScript Features and this Binding

Arrow Functions: I used arrow functions throughout the codebase to preserve the correct this context. In the main game loop (this.tick = (ts) => { ... }), the arrow function ensures that this always refers to the Game instance rather than the window object that requestAnimationFrame would normally bind to. Array methods like forEach, filter, and map also use arrow functions to maintain the proper context when processing game entities.

The this Keyword: The game demonstrates this binding in three key contexts. In the requestAnimationFrame loop, this refers to the Game instance thanks to the arrow function. In event listeners, I use both arrow functions for simple callbacks and method references for more complex scenarios. When calling class methods directly like this.player.update(), the this inside the update method correctly refers to the player instance.

Bind Usage: I used .bind(this) specifically for event listeners that need to be removed later for proper cleanup. In the Input class, this._onKeyDown = this.onKeyDown.bind(this) creates a stable function reference that can be both added and removed from event listeners. This prevents memory leaks and ensures the event handlers have access to the correct class instance. Arrow functions wouldn't work here because they create new function instances each time, making it impossible to remove them later.
